                <h3>Project Information</h3>
                <p>We were motivated to pursue this topic because we thought that looking at the top producing films from the years 2007-2011 would be a really interesting and insightful topic as film lovers. We chose to use bar charts and scatter plots to represent the data because we thought that these forms of visualization would best illustrate the distribution amongst the five years so we could take an in depth look at the profitability of these films. We tried to include, to the best of our ability, the five great qualities of visualization in order to bring to life the film industry and draw conclusions about what it means to create a holistically successful movie. From this project, we were able to gauge things like that action and comedy movies are at large the most profitable most years, or that dramas had really high audience scores. We believe these types of visualizations give a comprehensive overview of the film industries during these years while maintaining a beautiful narrative.                </p>
                <h3>Project Developement:</h3>
                <p>Our design began with thinking about how we wanted to represent the data in terms of the visualizations following the sketches we created in our proposal. We then decided that we wanted to make the visualizations interactive by having the graph reflect the year that the user is able to select from a drop down menu. Additionally, we used color as a key for different genres in the case of the first two sets of visualizations and as a key representing different producing studios for the last visualization. Each one of our group members focused on different visualizations but we made sure to communicate in order to achieve a sense of uniformity and make sure that we were telling a story with all of our data. The hardest part of this process was making sure all of our interactive pieces worked together and that there were no merge conflicts when people were working on different sections at different times. Overall, we worked well together and continue to find that strong communication is really pivotal in design and team success.                 </p>
